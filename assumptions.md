2. Assume the first and last name combined have to have at least 1 alphanumerical character.
(i.e. The handle also has at least 1 alphanumerical character and is not empty)
3. Assume we always return positive integer number for auth_user_id

# For channels/create/v2:
1. Assume the user who created this channel is always the owner of the channels.

5. Assume the token is in encrypted form.

# For channel/messages/v2:
1. Assume the start index can never be a negative number.
2. Assume there is currently no function that implements adding messages to a channel.

# For message/send/v1:
1. Assume the function always returns a positive integer number for message_id. 

# For dm/create/v1:
1. Assume the dm_id always be positive
2. Assume the u_ids are distinct u_ids
3. Assume the creator is a valid user

# For admin/user/remove/v1:
1. Assume other keys except for first name, last name and u_id of the removed users are empty.
2. Assume the token will be invalidated after the user is removed.

1. Assume when a user is tagged multiple times in one message, they only get one notification. 
2. Assume that users get a notification when they tag themselves

# For search/v1:
